# IoTHubBluetoothExplore

This is a folk of https://github.com/xamarin/Monkey.BluetoothLE updated to use .Net Standards 2 and the lastest version of Xamarin Form. The project also has integration with Azure IoT Hub so BLE sensor data could be streamed to Azure IoT Hub. Many thanks to https://github.com/DanRigby for helping me convert the project for PCL to .Net Standards
